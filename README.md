**This is my best GDI malware ever.**

56 payloads with a Solaris-style MBR :(). 

The MBR is a kernel in C - the Bootloader in x86 asm and the GDI are inspired by the psychedelic Salvia Divinorum (all in C#).

There are other very interesting payloads, change all windows file icons with a .ico loaded from the visual resource and change the cursor with the .cur loaded from the visual resource.

Made for the Italian YouTube channel "nFire".
